# CNN-for-Predicting-Dog-Cat-Images
Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project that classifies images as either Dogs or Cats using TensorFlow and Keras. This repository contains code for building, training, and testing a deep learning model for binary image classification.

# Project Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats. The dataset is preprocessed using image augmentation, and the model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras.

# echnologies Used
✔ Python
✔ TensorFlow & Keras
✔ OpenCV & NumPy
✔ Matplotlib (for visualization)

# Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:
1. Two Convolutional Layers with ReLU activation
2. Max Pooling Layers to reduce spatial dimensions
3. Flatten Layer to convert matrix into vector
4. Fully Connected (Dense) Layers for classification
5. Sigmoid Activation for binary classification
